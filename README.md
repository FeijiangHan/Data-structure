# Data-structure-study-notes---beta
* About 100,000 words of study notes on data structures, which I have recorded after studying online courses and online blogs.  The content includes: dynamic array, linked list, single linked list, bidirectional linked list, cyclic linked list, cyclic bidirectional linked list;  Stack, queue, double-ended queue;  Binary tree, balanced binary tree, AVL tree, binary search tree, red black tree, B tree, B + tree;  Hash maps, sets, trie prefix trees.
* This is a preliminary version that took me about 3-4 months to build and I will continue to work on it.
